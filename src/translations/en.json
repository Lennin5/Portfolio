I worked closely with a team of designers and other developers to ensure the delivery of high-quality solutions using best practices. <br /><br /> I also learned to develop different areas such as design, maintenance, optimization, and administration of them using the Odoo ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) environment. <br /><br /> At the same time, I proposed working with the ReactJS and Bootstrap framework for the development of some web applications, which allowed me to learn how to handle it more in real projects and contribute to the company with new ideas.",
